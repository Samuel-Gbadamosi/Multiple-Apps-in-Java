# Multiple-Apps-in-Java

This is a project created with java (Andriod Studio), a navigation drawer that links you to different apps created in the app,
Examples of app included in this project are 
Timer App (a timer that can be paused, reset and return to previous state)
Torch-Light App (We can access the torchlight on our phone to switch on/off controls)
Blog App (We can easily make a blog in Java and pass an array to the search view to access required contents)
Dice Game ( A dice game with pleasing results)
Camera App ( We can access the camera of our andriod device through an emulator or an andriod device on Developer Mode)
Love Calculator (A fake love calc to result your match with your partner)
Currency Converter App ( we can convert from pounds to euro)
Sound Recorder App ( That record and plays voice base on command given)
Calculator App
Bmi Calculator App ( body count app)
Most especially a very big thanks to my senior dev *Eduardo Gullo* that assisted during the creation of this project :)
